Section 7
___________
* The content is the one that guides the design of the project and not the opposite.
* don't come with a cool design and then find content to fill it.
* 1. write the content.

* in the css file, it is recommended that we put a system of the used fonts, sizes and 
  line heights to reference them in future uses.
  
  To keep the style consistent.
* The responsive element of the website is planned from the start.

* When a page is loaded, all relative units are converted to pixels.
* rem: root elementfont size, which is the default font-size that is specified by the root element (html element).

* to specify the user-defined rem value, we simply change the font size in the html element.
* we should use a percentage for that. eg. 16px -> 10px ---> 10 / 16 = 62.5%.
* max-width instead of width, to make the element shrink if the browser becomes smaller.

* if we set the hero section width to 100%, then it will grow as the window grows, but if width were set
  as pixels, then the element will shrink if the window shrinks.
  but a max-width is the best of both worlds.

* anchors are inline element, so top and bottom margins and padding do not work.
* border radius should be made by pixels.

* sometimes when we add border to an element, it plays with the layout, that's because
  the border is on the outside.

  to make the border inside, we will use the box-shadow trick and set it to inset.
* add the shared styles in the shared class.

* the transition is put in the steady state rule.
  it can have values that describes what properties will change, and the time.

* helper class, a class we put to multiple elements that share the same property.
  we should annotate it with the !important.

* to make the pictures overlap, we don't simply use a negative gap value for the 
  flex container, we use a margin of negative value.

* main element is used for sctions that are only used once in a website,
  so a navigation bar doesn't make sense if it is in a main.

* when making sticky elements, it is better to give it a fixed height.
* to add a nav bar, we simply add a component wherever we like, just add it 
  as a seperate section, not included in other.
